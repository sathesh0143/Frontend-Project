        The Taj Mahal Palace is a heritage, five-star, luxury hotel in the Colaba area of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, situated next to the Gateway of India. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, it opened in 1903 as the Taj Mahal Hotel and has historically often been known simply as "The Taj". The hotel is named after the Taj Mahal, which is located in the city of Agra approximately 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) from Mumbai. It has been considered one of the finest hotels in the East since the time of the British Raj. The hotel was one of the main sites targeted in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

Part of the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, the hotel has 560 rooms and 44 suites and is considered the flagship property of the group; it employs 1,600 staff. The hotel is made up of two different structures: the Taj Mahal Palace and the Tower, which are historically and architecturally distinct from each other (the Taj Mahal Palace was built in 1903; the Tower was opened in 1972).

The hotel has a long and distinguished history, having received many notable guests, from presidents to captains of industry and show business stars

    <th><P>Local pride in the face of colonial oppression is the subtext of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel located directly behind The Gateway to India.

        Its patron, the Parsi industrialist J.N. Tata, is said to have built the old Taj as an act of revenge after he was refused entry to what was then the best hotel in town, the “white only” Watson's. The ban proved to be its undoing, Watson's disappeared long ago, but the Taj still presides imperiously over the seafront, the preserve of Mumbai’s air-kissing jet set, visiting cricket teams and heads of state.
        
        I glide up a romantic staircase under stunning crystal chandelier before spilling into the bustling Sea Lounge. Located on the Palace Wing, Sea Lounge offers old colonial charm with art deco furniture and a live pianist enhanced by its spectacular view of the Arabian Sea.</P></th>
